# Minesweeper


Quick project to familiarize myself with object oriented python conventions, as well as how to create a project start to finish in Python.

Much of the code and design decisions can be traced back to a youtube tutorial found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqbGRZx4xUc

But the final product reflects my knowledge of Python well and the code was not simple copy-paste from the original tutorial.
 
 
 The code was developed over two or three days in May 2022.
